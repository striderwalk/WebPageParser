# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-Mar-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.
These need enough context so that a future reviewer can understand the reasons for the
decision and determine if the decision still stands.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in
[this article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset,
see [Nat Pryce's _adr-tools_](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
